This repos contains the core schema of the project and the binary `gqlast.py` that parses and generates graphql files from reference schema to libraries in use such as `gqlgen`, `dgraph` and `elm-graphql`.

The `graphql/` directory contains the shema source of the all other schemas and are used to generated valid graphql scheme for:

* dgraph (almost native graphql format): 
    * remove custom directives and comments (see issue #?).
    * Type that implements interface doesnt cant redefined the fiel -> Only the interface field are keeped bacause there are supposed to be more flexible.
* gqlgen and graphql-elm (native graphql format): dgraph shema is used to provide gqlgen and graphql-elm, whith custom logics:
        * types that implement interfaces need the inherit the fields of the mother interface (not needed for dgraph).
        * remove interface reference and change to standard type to simplify gqlgen implementation.
        * input directives are moved to the generated input od dgraph
        * dgraph types arguments are copied to original type if they don't exist.
        * manage duplicated type.

The generator output files in the fowlowing directories:

* gen/: Shema used by fractal6.go (glqgen) with custom queries and mutations.
* gen2/ Shema used by fractal6.go (glqgen) and fractal6.elm (graphql-elm) with custom schema from dgraph introspection.
* gen_dgraph_in: the shema givent to alter dgraph database.
* gen_dgraph_out: the schema generated by dgraph from the input one, with automatic queries, mutations and inputs generated.
